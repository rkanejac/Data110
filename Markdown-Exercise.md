# Hello and Welcome to my Markdown Page

### My favorite scripture is Proverbs 31:16-17 [^1]: 
> She surveys a field and acquires it; from her own resources, she plants a vineyard. She works energetically; her arms are powerful. 

This scripture talks about the importance of being curious, analytical, resourceful, and fruitful, which are all characteristics that data analysts/scientists have.

## Coding Exercise 
If you want to print a statement in Python, you can use ```print(hello);```

If you want to plot graph in Python, you have to import the matplotlib library, define x,y, or z points, and then plot the graph. The following code snippet shows an example of how to plot graphs in Python. 
```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [1,2,3]
y = [4,5,6]

ply.show()
ply.plot(x,y)
```
