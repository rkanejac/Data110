## My favorite scripture is Proverbs 31:16-17: 
> She surveys a field and acquires it; from her own resources, she plants a vineyard. She works energetically; her arms are powerful. 

This scripture talks about the importance of being curious, analytical, resourceful, and fruitful, which are all characteristics that data analyst/scientist have.
